# Apply progress: coding-tools

Mode: Strict TDD. Runner: `cargo test`. Delivery: ask-on-risk, feature-branch-chain.

## Batch 1: slice T (toggle plumbing, PR 3, branch feat/coding-tools-t, base feat/coding-tools)

| Task | Status | Commit |
|------|--------|--------|
| T.1 `[ai.tools]` booleans | done | feat(config): read the five coding-tools family toggles |
| T.2 owned keys in `ConfigEdit` | done | feat(config): own the family toggle keys in the comment-preserving edit |
| T.3 `FamilySet` from config into `ChatRequest.families` | done | feat(app): offer the families of the saved toggles to each chat turn |
| T.4 `max_rounds(set)` 8 / 24 | done | feat(chat): allow 24 Ollama rounds per turn when a coding family is on |
| T.5 five menu rows + caution line | done | feat(menu): add the five family toggle rows with a caution line |
| T.6 omit `tools` on an empty registry | done | fix(chat): omit the Ollama tools key when the registry is empty |

## TDD cycle evidence

| Task | RED (failing first) | GREEN | Triangulation | REFACTOR |
|------|---------------------|-------|---------------|----------|
| T.1 | `family_toggles_*`, wrong-type, notice order, master-switch tests did not compile (`ToolToggle`, `toggle`) | `ToolToggle`, `AiConfig::toggle/set_toggle`, `read_toggles` | default/on/wrong type/non-table/git independence/order of problems | none needed |
| T.2 | `ConfigEdit::toggle` missing; round-trip, comment-preservation, table-collision tests | `ConfigEdit::toggle`, `is_flag` covers the five keys | create, in place with comment, all five, KeyIsTable | none needed |
| T.3 | `AiConfig::families` missing; app test saw LEGACY for Search+GitWrite | `families()`, `offer_tools` sets `request.families` | none, each toggle, master off, app turn with 0 and 2 toggles | none needed |
| T.4 | `max_rounds` missing; loop test saw 8 bodies instead of 24 | `max_rounds`, `CODING_ROUNDS`, loop uses `limit` | pure fn over all 5 families + LEGACY/EMPTY, real loop at 24 | none needed |
| T.5 | `family_tests.rs` (order, kinds, nav, toggle keys, Enter repeat, edits, caution) did not compile; ~30 menu tests/snapshots failed on the new rows | `ItemKind::Family`, rows, `toggle_family`, `changed_toggles`, `caution`, reserved caution row | five rows x six keys, edit order, caution only on Write/Exec/GitWrite, size constant | tests re-pinned deliberately (see below) |
| T.6 | `an_empty_registry_leaves_the_tools_key_out_of_the_round_body` failed | key set only when the list is non-empty | EMPTY (absent) vs LEGACY (present) | none needed |

## T.5 churn (deliberate, reviewed)

- AI tab grows 11 -> 16 items; `VIEW_BODY` is now bound by the AI tab plus one reserved caution row (17), `MENU_BODY` 18, popup 22 rows high (was 16). The full popup needs 21 rows of terminal (was 15).
- 25 menu snapshots changed by pure blank-row/row additions (`git diff -U0 -- '*.snap'` shows no removed text except the two full-frame snapshots where the taller popup covers more of the panes). One new snapshot: `snapshot_exec_row_selected_shows_the_caution`.
- `cargo-insta` is not installed: snapshots were regenerated with `INSTA_UPDATE=always` and reviewed through `git diff`.

## Deviations

- The Exec row does not show the "needs Linux sandbox" reason: the jail check is not available to the menu yet, so it stays for X-d2 as the task allows.
- Row labels: `Search`, `Write`, `Exec`, `Git`, `Git write`.
- `AiConfig::families()` returns LEGACY when the master `[ai.tools] enabled` is off (spec: a family is active only when enabled is true).
- The popup grew by 6 rows; a terminal under 21 rows now gets the one-line fallback for the menu.

## Checks

`cargo fmt --check`, `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`, `cargo test` (all green), `cargo +1.88 check --all-targets`.
