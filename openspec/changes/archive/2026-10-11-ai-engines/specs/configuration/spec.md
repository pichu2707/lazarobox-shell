# Delta for Configuration

Purpose line of the main spec MUST be updated at archive (a MODIFIED block cannot do it). New text: "A user config file read once at startup. It places the statusline and the tab bar, and records the default AI engine and model. Tags: [auto] = `cargo test`; [manual] = real Kitty."

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Schema and defaults
The file is TOML with `[statusline] position` and `[tabbar] position`, each `"top"` or `"bottom"`, a top-level `mouse` boolean, and `[ai] engine` and `[ai] model`, each a string. Defaults: statusline `"bottom"`, tabbar `"top"`, `mouse = false`, `ai.engine` and `ai.model` unset (no engine, no model). An empty string equals unset. Any key may be omitted. Unknown keys and tables MUST be ignored. All four position combinations are valid. Any string is valid for `ai.engine` and `ai.model`, including an id that is not in the engine catalog; it MUST be kept as written and MUST NOT raise a notice. No secret is part of the schema.
(Previously: no `[ai]` table.)

#### Scenario: Defaults [auto]
- GIVEN an empty file
- WHEN it is parsed
- THEN statusline is bottom, tabbar is top, mouse is false, and ai engine and model are unset

#### Scenario: Each value [auto]
- GIVEN a file that sets one position
- WHEN it is parsed
- THEN that position changes and the other keeps its default

#### Scenario: Unknown keys ignored [auto]
- GIVEN a file with unknown keys and tables next to valid ones
- WHEN it is parsed
- THEN the valid keys apply and no error is raised

#### Scenario: AI keys parsed [auto]
- GIVEN `[ai]` with `engine = "ollama"` and `model = "llama3:8b"`
- WHEN it is parsed
- THEN ai engine is `ollama`, ai model is `llama3:8b`, and no notice is produced

#### Scenario: Unknown engine id kept [auto]
- GIVEN `[ai]` with `engine = "future-engine"`
- WHEN it is parsed
- THEN ai engine is `future-engine` and no notice is produced

#### Scenario: Empty string is unset [auto]
- GIVEN `[ai]` with `engine = ""` and `model = ""`
- WHEN it is parsed
- THEN ai engine and model are unset

### Requirement: Fallback and startup notice
A missing file MUST silently give the defaults. An unreadable file or unparseable TOML (a syntax error) MUST give all the defaults and a startup notice `config: <short error>` (one line) shown through the existing statusline notice until the next key.

An invalid value or type MUST fall back to the default for THAT KEY ONLY; every other key in the file is respected. The notice names the failing key, for example `config: statusline.position: expected "top" or "bottom"`; when several keys fail it reports the count and the first: `config (N problems): <first problem>`. A non-table section (`statusline = 3`) reports `statusline: expected a table`, and a non-boolean `mouse` reports `mouse: expected true or false`. A non-string `ai.engine` or `ai.model` reports `ai.engine: expected a string` or `ai.model: expected a string`, and a non-table `ai` reports `ai: expected a table`.

`mouse = true` MUST be accepted with no effect and the notice `config: mouse is not supported yet` (a key problem notice wins over it).
(Previously: no `ai` problems were defined.)

#### Scenario: Missing file [auto]
- GIVEN no config file
- WHEN the app starts
- THEN the defaults apply and no notice shows

#### Scenario: Invalid value falls back per key [auto]
- GIVEN `[statusline] position = "middle"` and `[tabbar] position = "bottom"` and `mouse = true`
- WHEN the app starts
- THEN the statusline is at the default (bottom), the tab bar is at the bottom, mouse is true, and the notice is `config: statusline.position: expected "top" or "bottom"`

#### Scenario: Several invalid keys [auto]
- GIVEN invalid values for `mouse`, `statusline.position` and `tabbar.position`
- WHEN the app starts
- THEN all three use their defaults and the notice is `config (3 problems): ` followed by the first key's problem

#### Scenario: Unparseable file [auto]
- GIVEN a file with a TOML syntax error
- WHEN the app starts
- THEN all defaults apply and the notice is `config: <short parse error>`

#### Scenario: Mouse reserved [auto]
- GIVEN `mouse = true`
- WHEN the app starts
- THEN it is accepted and the notice is `config: mouse is not supported yet`

#### Scenario: Invalid AI types fall back per key [auto]
- GIVEN `[ai]` with `engine = 3` and `model = "llama3:8b"`, and `[tabbar] position = "bottom"`
- WHEN the app starts
- THEN ai engine is unset, ai model is `llama3:8b`, the tab bar is at the bottom, and the notice is `config: ai.engine: expected a string`

#### Scenario: Non-table ai [auto]
- GIVEN a file with `ai = 3`
- WHEN the app starts
- THEN ai engine and model are unset and the notice is `config: ai: expected a table`

#### Scenario: Positions in Kitty [manual]
- GIVEN each of the four combinations in `~/.config/lazarobox/config.toml`
- WHEN the app runs with one and with three tabs
- THEN the bars sit where configured and nvim fills the rest
